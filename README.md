# Screenly: Create beautiful screenshots

## Usage
```
node index.js
Go to localhost:8080/welcome
```

1. upload a screenshot of your phone (16:9 aspect ratio)
2. choose the color you want
3. your framed screenshot will be generated automatically

## Limitations
The upload screenshot name is hardcoded to 'screen1.PNG'. So only screenshot with this exact name will be processed.
